title = 'Why k64d'
+++

The purpose of this website is to share learnings of my life. The name k64d is special since 'k' and 'd' represent initials for mine and my spouse's name. '64' also has a special significance - 64 bit is the size of registers on a modern CPU, coincidentally 6 is my date of birth and 4 is my spouse's dob, hence the name **k64d**. A part of this format is inspired from Andressen Horowitz website *a16z*, I'm an avid reader of his blog and Paul Graham's.
